# Preparations
Basically all you need (other than git) are basic build tools. These are contained in base-devel.
Additionally installing ccache will speed compilation up by a lot. (Well - the first one will be pretty slow, but every further one will be pretty fast.)

# Installation
Couterarch was designed for installation on a clean arch linux. It is actually pretty simple to install.

1. Run buid.sh and follow the instructions
2. Update your bootloaders config (for example grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg)

# Updating
Updating your counterarch kernel is pretty simple. Just rerun build.sh and follow the instructions ;)
